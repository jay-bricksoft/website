        On June 20th, the Legal Committee of the EU Parliament votes on the proposed <span class="text-orange">Copyright Directive</span>. The only ones who can stop this fatal law now are the Members of the European Parliament(MEP)!

            <p>
                Upload filters on sites like Youtube, Facebook etc. have one thing in common: They will never work as accurate as a real human. As a consequence, copyrighted content that is used under fair use laws, gets deleted. This "tendancy" could be abused to filter content that's not in line with the companies values and interests.

                In the future, press publishers will be required to bill for any links someone makes to their content. News portals are thus nullified. No to the link tax!

                    You can contact your Deputy directly to show him or her your displeasure with the draft law. Personal mails or conversations via telephone often have a huge impact because people with whom you talk directly are open to new opinions and more willingly to be re-tuned.

            <h3>Article 13 in detail</h3>
            <p>
                Article 13 requires in practice that almost all internet platforms install a "filter robot" which automatically checks all uploaded content. This unduly restricts freedom of expression before it can be used. Content censorship decision is left to error-prone and oversensitive algorithms (programmed to "play it safe" and erase anything that creates a risk for the platform in case of doubt).

            <h3>Article 11 in detail</h3>
            <p>
                In ancillary copyright law (Article 11), it is stipulated that the content of certain information providers will in future be subject to specific media law. This means that already quoted texts could be declared a copyright infringement.
                A large part of the providers of news on the net will be affected by this, since the use of external links will be restricted or paid.

                Research and progress are also suffering from Article 11. In the future, users, such as independent researchers, journalists, individuals and various companies, will be denied text and data mining. This has a slowing effect on various discoveries of public interest.
